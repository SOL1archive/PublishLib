This libray is for maintaining personal blog based on markdown. This library supports processing markdown files to change .md files automatically upload to blog servers. When you try to upload your personal .md file, you have to add some toc and toc indexes, change header indexes, etc. This process is quite boring and easy to mistake. This library helps you to do those process. You just make a pipeline and this library automatically makes what you want.
